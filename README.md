# Pharmaceutical Development - Idea to Market Platform

A comprehensive web-based application for managing pharmaceutical product development from concept to commercialization, with specialized support for FDF, API, and Innovation pipelines.

## Overview

Pharmaceutical Development is a lightweight, browser-based project management tool designed specifically for pharmaceutical companies, R&D teams, and drug development professionals. The application provides intuitive interfaces for tracking products through the development lifecycle, managing clinical milestones, and orchestrating complex development tasks—all without requiring backend infrastructure.

1. Navigate to the "Development Tasks" view
2. Click "Add Development Task" to create a new milestone or task
3. Fill in task details:
   - Select the associated product
   - Enter task/milestone name (e.g., "Complete stability studies", "Submit IND")
   - Add task description
   - Set priority (including Critical/Regulatory for urgent regulatory activities)
   - Assign to team member
   - Set target completion date
   - Define task dependencies
4. Drag and drop tasks between columns as work progresses
5. Edit or delete tasks as development plans evolve

#### Tracking Development Progress

- View the Dashboard for an overview of your entire development pipeline
- Check task completion percentages on product cards
- Monitor statistics: Total Products, Active Development, Completed Milestones
- Click on any product card to see detailed development information
- Filter tasks by product to focus on specific development programs
